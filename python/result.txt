when you're down,
and the world seems dark and empty,
Your forever friend lifts you up in spirits and makes that dark and empty
world
suddenly seem bright and full.
Your forever friend gets you through the hard times,the sad times,and the
confused times.
If you turn and walk away,
Your forever friend follows,
If you lose you way,
Your forever friend guides you and cheers you on.
Your forever friend holds your hand and tells you that everything is going
Sometimes in life,
You find a special friend;
